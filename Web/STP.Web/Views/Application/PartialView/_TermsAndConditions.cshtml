                NOTE: ESDAL requires you to
                acknowledge your acceptance of
                the terms and conditions for notification. To begin notifying, you must tick the
                box below and click the ‘Next’ button.

                <li>
                    By accepting these Terms and Conditions you accept that the
                    data entered for the movement is as accurate as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ESDAL shall attempt to send a notification to all appropriate
                    authorities via ESDAL as designated by the recipient’s preference
                    (inbox, email or fax). The list of recipients is determined from the route planned
                    via the route planning tool, and information supplied to ESDAL by structure owners , road
                    owners and local authorities. ESDAL cannot guarantee the accuracy and completeness of this
                    data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ESDAL cannot guarantee that the notification is received in a readable state.
                    For example, ESDAL can confirm that a fax notification has been received by a
                    fax machine, but not that it has been printed legibly. Similarly, ESDAL cannot guarantee
                    that an email has been received, but will include a request to confirm receipt within
                    the email notification.
